          Hello. My name is Chander, and I am a software engineer passionate
          about technology and science.
        </p>
        <p>
          In my free time, I enjoy practicing Jiu-Jitsu, which has taught me
          discipline, focus, and the importance of continual learning and
          growth.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been fascinated by the power of technology to solve
          complex problems and improve people's lives. I constantly look for new
          challenges and opportunities to grow as an engineer.
        </p>
